OL07.py
-------
Reference:
    Ormel & Cuzzi (2007)

Calculation of particle's relative velocity in turbulent flows. The turbulent
power spectrum is assumed to be Kolmogorov.


OL18.py
-------
Reference:
    Ormel & Liu (2018)
    Liu & Ormel (2018)

Calculation of the pebble accretion probability for a single planet for
pebble-sized particles of Stokes number St<1. Expressions account for planet on
a Keplerian orbit and for a quite general turbulence model. Expressions have
been calibrated against three-body simulations.


HO23.py
-------
Reference:
    Huang & Ormel (2023, in preparation)

Calculation of pebble accretion probability (epsilon) for a single planet in
the limit of aerodynamically large pebbles (St>1). The expressions apply only
for a planet on a circular orbit.
